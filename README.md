Task:
Github Users Search Tool

You need to create a github users search tool. 
On the main page there should be an input field where you need to enter a username. 
Below should be a filtered list of users. 
There should be an implementation of pagination (infinite scroll). 

Clicking on a row should open the user's page with additional information about him:
 - avatar image, 
 - name, 
 - followers, 
 - following, 
 - company, 
 - email, 
 - blog

This project should be written using React. Using Typescript would be a plus. 
We would also appreciate the use of any state management and UI libraries.

The following technologies were used:
React,Redux etc.
